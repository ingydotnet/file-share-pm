NAME
    File::Share - Extend File::ShareDir to Local Libraries

SYNOPSIS
        use File::Share ':all';

        my $dir = dist_dir('Foo-Bar');
        my $file = dist_file('Foo-Bar', '

DESCRIPTION
    THis module is a dropin replacement for File::ShareDir. It supports the
    "dist_dir" and "dist_file" functions, except these functions have been
    enhanced to understand when the developer's local "./share/" directory
    should be used.

    NOTE: module_dist and module_file are not yet supported, because (afaik)
    there is no well known way to populate per-module share files. This may
    change in the future.

PROBLEM AND SOLUTION
    Module::Install has an "install_share" directive that allows you to
    install various files associated with a distribution. By convention,
    module authors always put these in a directory called "share/". However,
    File::ShareDir can only find files after they have been installed. This
    can be problematic when running development tests.

    File::Share will look for a local "share" directory, if it notices that
    the module corresponding was loaded from a development path.

    Devel::Local gives you an easy way to use a bunch of source repositories
    as though their lib and bin directories had already been installed.
    "File::Share" lets you play along with that.
